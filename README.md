Hello! Iâ€™m a third-year Computer Science student with a strong passion for learning and exploring new technologies. While I have experience in full-stack development, Iâ€™m particularly interested in embedded systems and computer vision. The integration of hardware and software in embedded systems fascinates me, and Iâ€™m excited by the potential of computer vision to solve real-world challenges.
